redshift 1.1.50

- Optimization: algebraic flows that are current at end of step_continuous
  don't need to be evaled until d_tick > 1.

redshift 1.1.49

- Minor optimization: strict alg. vars in a non-strict alg expr are
  evaled only once per discrete step.

redshift 1.1.48

- Added new benchmark framework, and the discrete and constinuous benchmarks.

redshift 1.1.47

- Optimization for 'inert' components.

- More useful interface for Component.state.

redshift 1.1.46

- Resets for links.

redshift 1.1.45

- Resets for constants.

redshift 1.1.44

- Fixed reporting of strictness violations.

- Added test/test_strict_reset_error.rb.

- Outgoing transitions are cached for each state.

redshift 1.1.43

- Optimization for strictly continuous var readers.

redshift 1.1.42

- Added runtime check for strictness violation due to transition to state
  with inconsistent algebraic equation.

redshift 1.1.41

- Added infrastructure for checking strictness and strictness violations
  at run time.

redshift 1.1.40

- Strictness violations of writers can be rescued, and the value remains set.

- Renaned ContinuousAssignmentError to StrictnessError

- World#age removed; use #evolve instead.

- Improved test_strict_continuity.rb.

redshift 1.1.39

- Added World.defaults.

redshift 1.1.38

- Added strict links.
