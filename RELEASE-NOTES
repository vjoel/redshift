- Optimization: use diff_list in step_continuous to scan just those components
  that have diff flows.

- Improved bechmark framework and outputs; added new benchmarks.

redshift 1.1.58

- Event values may now be C exprs. Use #literal to force literal string/proc.

redshift 1.1.57

- Changed behavior when leaving state in which var is defined by alg flow,
  and entering state with no alg flow.

- Resets are now allowed in algebraic state, even if the reset value will be
  overridden by the next alg evaluation.

redshift 1.1.56

- Misc fixes, cleanup, and tests.

redshift 1.1.55

- Re-fixed bug with order in which guards are checked.

- Defaults and setup clauses can take a hash of var=>value, as can variable
  declarations.

redshift 1.1.54

- Fixed bug with transition S=>S and strict guards.

- Fixed bug with order in which guards are checked.

redshift 1.1.53

- Fixed bug with both link.contvar and link.constant in one gaurd expr.

redshift 1.1.51

- Added NonStrictLink test to test_strict_continuity.rb.

redshift 1.1.50

- Optimization: algebraic flows that are current at end of step_continuous
  don't need to be evaled until d_tick > 1.

redshift 1.1.49

- Minor optimization: strict alg. vars in a non-strict alg expr or guard are
  evaled only once per discrete step.
