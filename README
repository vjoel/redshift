= RedShift

A framework for simulation of networks of hybrid automata, similar to SHIFT and Lambda-SHIFT. Includes ruby-based DSL for defining simulation components, and ruby/C code generation and runtime.

There's no documentation yet. Start with the examples.

== Requirements

RedShift needs ruby 1.8.x and a compatible C compiler. If you can build native gems, you're all set.

== Env vars

If you have a multicore system and are using the gnu toolchain, set

REDSHIFT_MAKE_ARGS='-j -l2'

or some variation. You'll find that rebuilds of your simulation code go faster.
