Bugs

  Make sure the arrays used internally are not shared:
  call rb_ary_modify() before setting len or etc.
  
  discrete_update is not reentrant -- fix by putting globals
  into world state
  
  what happens if an exception (or throw or break) happens inside
  of a block during discrete_update? (e.g. an action, reset, or
  guard block)
  
Syntax

  should be possible to allow:
  
    reset x => ... instead of reset :x => ...

  replace strictly_* with strict_* and alias back for compat

  express flows, guards, etc, in ruby syntax and use something to parse:
  
    nodedump/nodewrap
    
    ripper
    
    "expansion.rb"

    vars are class methods returning Var obejcts

      resets and even assignment to cont-vars can use '<<'

      equations can use '=='

  reset syntax:
  
    reset do
      x 3
      y "x+2"
      z { (x-y).abs }

  check for symbol conflicts
    user attributes may conflict with Component's attrs
    ditto for flows and other methods defined in subclasses
    can we 'hook' method def and attr def to check for conflict? 
    or just use a consistent naming scheme to keep internals separate?
  
  flow /Foo.*/ ...
    matches on name of states

Semantics

  register event observers:
    on comp=>event do ... end

  Does permissive make sense?

  Add a #connect method:
  
    link :comp => [C, :x, :y, :z]
    ...
    action do
      self.comp = C.new
      connect :comp, :x => :x_in_c, ...
    end
    
  or:
    
    link :comp => Connector(:x)
    action/setup do
      other = create(SomeComp)
      connect [:comp, :x] => [other, :y]
    end
    flow do
      "  u'  =  comp.x  "
    end
    
    creates a new connector component so that neither self nor SomeComp
    nor other need to know statically the offset of the other guy's var
    
    (do we need to specify :x ??)

  inheritance among states:
  
    "state Foo has everything that Bar has, plus ...."

  how to set a local var during a transition (which can be accessed by
  events, actions, resets):
    
    transition do
      local :x
      action do
        local.x = y
      end
      reset :z => proc { local.x }
    end

    transition do
      action do |local|
        local.x = y   # or local["x"] = y
      end
      reset :z => proc { |local| local.x }
    end
    
    transition do
      reset local.x => "y*2", :y => "local.x - 3"
      action { local.x += 1}
    end
    
    use || or use standard name
    predeclare or use method_missing or use hash or:
      local { Hash.new } # or struct_with :x, :y

  a transition that can happen only once per discrete step, to easily
  prevent zeno pb (useful for utility transitions, such as output)
  
    better: a "pre-strict" var that can only get reset once per step

  per-state strictness?
  
  if  guard "strictvar && something" is checked and strictvar is false,
    then the guard doesn't need to be checked again, regardless of "something"
    similarly for:  guard "strictvar"; guard "something"
  
  "finalizers" for components -- called when component exits, world
   is finalized, or app quits
  
    more generally, code that executes when a given state is entered:
    
      state Exit do
        # do some finalization stuff here
      end

    Or:
    
      entering SomeState do...end
      exiting SomeState do...end
    
    Maybe this is better handled by adding another state (PreSomeState)
  
  abstract classes (no code generated)
  
  input events (in place of interrupts?)
  
    as opposed to normal events, which are output (pull vs. push)
    
    but does this mean arriving events are queued?
    
    this would be useful for timers so that client component doesn't
    have to manage a ref to the timer
  
  wait/sleep
    
    in a transition, saying "sleep n" says that the component will not
    check guards for the rest of that discrete update and for n time units.
    
  exception handler clauses in transitions (or use interrupts?)
    on LockFailed { |var, value| ... }
  
  state stack:
    a transition (or interrupt) can push the current state or pop back
      to a previously saved state (like Kader's idea)
    syntax:
      transition ... do
        push [or pop, in which case the dest. state is ignored]
      end
  
  interrupts
    a way of enabling a transition without evaluating guards
      -faster
    can do sender-receiver, rather than broadcast
    can register with global interrupt manager
      notify after T seconds
      notify when global event happens (like what?)
    receive in any state, switch to new state optional (push ok)
    synchronous in the sense that no other components act in between
      the send and receive, and the receiver action happens before the
      sender action finishes (?)
    but not parallel assignment
    based on methods
    in sender's action clause: 'x.foo args'
    in receiver:
      interrupt :foo => NewState do
        action { |args| ...}
        event ...
      end
  
  signals
    maybe better than interrupts, more general
    
    transition ... do
      signal value => receiver_collection, ...
    end
    
    on value do ... end
    
    is this better than a simple method call?
      yes: can implement queue

  discrete evolution
    more flexibility:
      start actions as well as finish actions
      (before/after)
      enter and exit blocks for each state
      start_when and finish_when to implement sync
    transitions like in statechart
    parametric transitions?
    attach :all, ...
    syncronization
      explicit?

  exceptions
    catch them if they arise in action
    pass them on to handler where?
  
  might be better not to raise or rb_raise, but to call redshift_error on the
  world class, which the class could override as needed

Implementation

  remove -g (if not debug) from CFLAGS
    add -march=i686 -msse2 -mfpmath=sse (keep -fPIC?)
    or whatever current hw is (how to determine that?)

  possible to use only 1 tmp value for rk4?

  optimization: transitive closure of strict sleep, based on declaration
    that prevents setters
  
  optimization: weaken "strict" so that resets can apply at end of
    discrete update, but still get all the optimizations (see bench/discrete.rb)
    
    - a new kind of flow that applies an "impulse" to a strict var at the
      beginning of the next cont step, or
      
    - a declaration that a var becomes strict for the rest of the discrete
      step
  
  Allow c-coded actions:
  
    transition do
      action " func(self, x*2, lnk.y) "
    end
    
    cdef <<END
      func(SelfShadowClass *self, double arg1, double arg2) {
        ...
      }
    END

  Debug mode that uses hooks to add extra checking:
  
    - d_tick rollovercheck
    
    - check_strict (and make it *not* the default)

  Instead of caching flow function in each cont var, maybe just have pointer
  to a single per state object? This can also have the outgoing transitions,
  and so __update_cache can be somewhat faster.

  share mark and free funcs where possible (e.g., guards)
  
  guards should not be written in numerical order (".._0", "..._1"), but
  in a more meaningful way so that changing order doesn't force recompile
  
  unified internal repr. for phases
  
  insert a mnemonic for quick detection of phase type in discrete update

  distribute Init_clib better
  
  break flow-gen.rb and world-gen.rb into several files each
    flow-gen files can be loaded on demand as flow types are needed
  
  optimization
    profiling
      use valgrind, gprof, etc. to profile the C code
    compare with shift, matlab
      
  run time error checking
    more 'if $DEBUG ...' checks
    catch definition of flows after commit, etc.
    
  exception handling
    syntax and math errors, esp. in flows, guards
    use Exception classes

  error messages

    Current file/line position must be saved by many constructs, e.g. reset,
      so that it can be shown later if there is an error message
    
    use ", []" to avoid showing backtrace when it is not helpful
    
    exceptions in C code sometimes don't give symbolic info, like var names

  check against ruby 1.9
  
    replace RARRAY(x)->len with RARRAY_LEN(x)

  dot backend (see file in lib dir)
